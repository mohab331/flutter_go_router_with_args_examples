# Go Router Navigation App

This is a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to use Go Router navigation using enhanced enums and extensions. It also shows how to pass parameters between screens using three types: params, queryParams, and extras. The main focus of this project is on Go Router navigation and passing data between screens. 

## Screens

| Screen            | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Login Screen      | Allows the user to log in with no validation. Upon pressing the login button, it navigates to the home screen. |
| Home Screen       | After successful login, displays the home screen. From here, users can navigate to dummy "About Us" and "Contact Us" screens. |
| About Us Screen   | contains dummy text. Serves as a placeholder for demonstrating navigation|
| Contact Us Screen | contains dummy text. Serves as a placeholder for demonstrating navigation. |

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and packages were used to develop this project:

- Flutter
- Flutter BLoC
- Go Router


## Usage

Once the app is running on your device or emulator, you can explore the different screens and navigation features provided by the app.

1. On the login screen, press the login button to navigate to the home screen.

2. On the home screen, you will find buttons to navigate to the "About Us" and "Contact Us" screens.

3. Press the "About Us" button to navigate to the About Us screen. Similarly, press the "Contact Us" button to navigate to the Contact Us screen.

4. The navigation between screens utilizes the Go Router package, and you can observe how parameters are passed between screens using different methods such as params, queryParams, and extras.

Feel free to explore the codebase to understand how the navigation and data passing logic has been implemented.
